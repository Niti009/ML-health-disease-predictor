# ML-health-disease-predictor
A ML and python based health based predictor which shows the risk and probabilities of potential risks using input values given to the system.
It mainly focuses on the conceptss of machine learning algorithms and python. 
The datasets are imported from kaggle and fed into th ML algos opening up to a webpage where 3 diseases are mainly tried upon i.e. parkinsons,heart problems and diabetes.
It analyses the data provided and then predicts the problems and its associated risk based on the input provided. The input provded are the raw data which determines how the machine learning algos are implemented. 
The ML algos used are SVM(Support Vector Machine), Logistic Regression,Decision trees and Random Forest. Best algos with good accuracies are SVM and logistic regression.
